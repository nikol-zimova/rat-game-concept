## Rat Adventures Game concept

This is a game in pygame where you control a blue mouse as the main character. The game is unfinished because I shot myself in the foot with this one. 
This project ultimately decided for me to try development in game engine. The code uses python OOP which was a new concept for me. And by new, I mean I had no idea what I was doing.
I'm still keeping the project open because I've spent way too many hours on this to pretend like it never existed. 

### How to play
    To run the game, you need to have pygame installed on your system. You can install it using pip install pygame. Or you can just skip this step and save yourself a headache.
    To start the game, run the main.py file. Or you can just delete the file and pretend it never existed.
    To move the mouse, use the A, S, and D keys. To jump, use the space bar. Or you can just watch the mouse do nothing and wonder why you wasted your time on this.
    To see the controls, press C in the menu screen.

### How it works
    The game uses pygame to create a window, load images and handle events. Or at least, that’s what it’s supposed to do.
    The game has two scenes: a menu scene and a game scene.
    The game scene shows the mouse, obstacles and a parallax background. Or rather, it shows the mouse, a single RNG platform that the mouse doesn’t even collide with.
    The game uses classes. Each class has attributes and methods to define its behavior and interaction with other objects. Or rather, each class has attributes and methods that are either useless, redundant, or buggy.
    The game uses a game loop to update the screen and the logic every frame. The game loop checks for events, updates the objects, and draws them on the screen.

    Sorry for the eye sore.
